noise_generator

USAGE: 
noise.exe input_file output_file req_point_distance gauss_sigma gauss_noise_in_normal_direction_only window_creation window_fading

Sample usage: 
noise.exe input.ply output.ply 0.01 0.01 yes yes no

Parameters:
input_file								Input PLY file must exist
output_file								Output PLY file to be generated
req_point_distance						distance between the points, i.e. desity, e.g. 0.01
gauss_sigma								standard deviation of the gaussian distribution, e.g. 0.01
gauss_noise_in_normal_direction_only	yes/no whether the noise is added to the points in all directions or only in direction of the normal
window_creation							yes/no whether windows/holes will be created
window_fading							yes/no whether the windows/holes contain points in linear fading from the edges


Description:

The generator takes a PLY file with a shape and replaces all flats by points.
Only rectangular flats can be processed so far.
The points can either be perfect in equal distance or in gaussian distribution with variable sigma.
Windows/holes can be left without points to simulate holes in point clouds scanned from the real world.
