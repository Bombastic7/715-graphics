graph_manip

Implementation of the graph manipulation operation. Input is ply or pcd file and config file, output is delivered in stdout and visualisation window.

The input point cloud is clustered into faces and a graph is produced.
The FIX-BAD-NODE operation is applied to the graph, with node replacement information output to stdout.
The final point cloud is produced from the modified graph, and shown in a visualisation window. Visualisation has each cluster a different colour.

Cluster information, adjacency, and similarity values are output in file clusters.txt.

See comments in graph_manip.cpp for more information.


Parameters:
inputfile             string, input ply or pcd file
pc_dist_th            float, RANSAC model distance threshold
pc_sample_max_dist    float, RANSAC max distance between samples each iteration
pc_eps_angle          float, radians, RANSAC, maximum angular deviation between each point's estimated normal and its fitted plane
pc_min_points         int, minimum points per plane-cluster
norm_est_k            int, normal estimation, size of neighbourhood
fc_maxrad             float, Euclidean clustering search radius
adj_sz                float, region size for adjacency detection
adj_k                 int, minimum nearby points needed in adjacent clusters
project_points        Boolean, project points onto their fitted planes prior to graph manipulation
use_coolwarm_vis      Boolean, use cool-warm colour scale in visualisation. Otherwise use rainbow scale

A brief overview of face clustering algorithm:
  Cluster cloud into planes using RANSAC.
  Cluster planes into faces using Euclidean clustering.
  Detect adjacency by counting how many points in each cluster are within range to a point in each other cluster.
  Possibly project points onto their fitted planes.


Graph operation is described in graph_manip.cpp.
